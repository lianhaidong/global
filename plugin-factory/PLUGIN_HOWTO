                ----------------------------------

Plugin-factory directory ('plugin-factory/' in the GLOBAL package) is a factory
of plug-in parser. It has three plug-in parsers which are installed into the
system by default.

Nop parser('user-custom.c')
	A skeleton parser. Nothing has been implemented yet.
Exuberant Ctags('exuberant-ctags.c')
	A parser to use Exuberant Ctags.
Pygments + Exuberant Ctags('pygments-parser.c')
	A parser to use Pygments and Exuberant Ctags.

How to write a plug-in parser?
==============================

You should write a parser function in the nop parser like follows (pseudo code):

#include "parser.h"
void
parser(const struct parser_param *param)
{
	open param->file
	while (read from file) {
		if (definition)
			param->put(PARSER_DEF, ...);
		else if (reference)
			param->put(PARSER_REF_SYM, ...);
		else
			...
	}
	close file
}

A param argument is given to each parser function.
param->file is the path name of a source file which should be parsed.

You can write a tag using the param argument like follows:

o write a tag to GTAGS

	param->put(PARSER_DEF, <tag name>, <line no>, <file name>, <line image>, param->arg);

o write a tag to GRTAGS

	param->put(PARSER_REF_SYM, <tag name>, <line no>, <file name>, <line image>, param->arg);

Note: 
o Gtags always makes 'GRTAGS' file even if you don't use PARSER_REF_SYM.
o You can write a plug-in parser independently with GLOBAL except for 'parser.h'.
  Plug-in factory is supplied only for your convenience.

How to use Exuberant Ctags as a parser?
=======================================

'exuberant-ctags.la' is a shared library to use Exuberant Ctags,
and is installed to /usr/local/lib/gtags by default.

To use this parser, please do like follows:

        [Installation of GLOBAL]

        It assumed that ctags command is installed in '/usr/local/bin'.

        $ ./configure --with-exuberant-ctags=/usr/local/bin/ctags
        $ make
        $ sudo make install

        [Executing of gtags]

        It assumed that GLOBAL is installed in '/usr/local' which is the default.

        $ export GTAGSCONF=/usr/local/share/gtags/gtags.conf
        $ export GTAGSLABEL=ctags
        $ gtags                         # invokes Exuberant Ctags internally

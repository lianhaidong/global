GNU GLOBAL NEWS - User visible changes.
At least, you had better search '[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]' for each version.

Version 5.7.4 - January 5 2009

[CHANGES]
o global: In compact format, operation to non-existent lines was changed
	to avoid needless abnormal termination.

	-- Delete lines 20-last from the test.c.
	$ global -xr func

	(OLD)
	func      10 test.c           func(a);
	global: unexpected end of file. './test.c: 19/20'
	$ echo $?
	1                                       <- abnormal termination

	(NEW)
	func      10 test.c           func(a);
	func      20 test.c                     <- plain space means non-existence
	$ echo $?
	0                                       <- normal termination

[FIXED BUGS]
o gtags-parser: Gtags-parser had overlooked objects in 'extern "C" {...}'(C, C++).
  Now, it can pick up them.
o gtags-parser: Gtags-parser was not able to recognize the following definitions.
  Now, it can pick up them.

        int invisible /* COMMENT */ ()
        {
        }

        int also_invisible // COMMENT
        ()
        {
        }

        int visible () // COMMENT
        {
        }
o gtags-parser: Gtags-parser had overlooked 'Foo' in the following construct.
  Now, it can pick up them.

        namespace
        Foo
        { ...

  However, this works:

        namespace Foo
        { ...


Version 5.7.3 - October 29 2008

[FIXED BUGS]
gtags: Gtags causes segmentation fault if it read its input file names from
a file list (use -f option), and the input files aren't in the working
directory or its sub-directories.
gtags.pl: Version test is failed.

Version 5.7.2 - September 30 2008

[CHANGES]
New functions:
o gtags: New -O(--objdir) option added.
o gtags.el: New gtags-select-tag-other-window and gtags-find-tag-other-window command added.
o htags: Supported 'include', 'required' and 'required_once' statement in PHP language.
  Htags makes a link to the file described in above statements if it is accessible from
  current directory.

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
o gtags: Changed to skip all files whoes first character of name is '.'.
  The following path was deleted from the DEFAULTSKIP in configure.ac, since new rule
  covers them.

        .notfunction
        .gdbinit
        .cvsrc
        .cvsignore
        .gitignore
        .cvspass
        .cvswrappers
        .deps/
        .snprj/
        .svn/
        .git/

o gtags.el: Changed so that the visited files are left after invoking
  the 'gtags-pop-stack' command. If you hope old specification,
  please set gtags-pop-delete to true like follows:

        [$HOME/.emacs]
        (setq gtags-mode-hook
          '(lambda ()
                (setq gtags-pop-delete t)))

Version 5.7.1 - April 21 2008

[CHANGES]
New functions:
o gtags-parser: Pick up symbols in #{if,elif,ifdef,ifndef} line in assembly source.

Other changes:
o gtags.conf: Added new skip files: cscope.po.out,cscope.in.out
o gtags.vim: Added error check for the -f option.

[FIXED BUGS]
o Fixed imperfect symbolic link support.
  - global: Global didn't work with the -f option.
  - gozilla: Gozilla couldn't convert paths which include symbolic linked directory.

Version 5.7 - March 25 2008

[CHANGES]
New functions:
o gtags: Allows the symbolic links which point to directories.
  In older version, such symbolic links were ignored with warning messages.

	[Example]

	/tmp
	  +-global
	  |  +-GTAGS
	  |  +-gtags ----+ (symbolic link to ../work/gtag2)
	  |  +-htags --+ | (symbolic link to ../work/htag2)
	  |            | |
	  +-work       | |
	     +-gtag2 <-+ |
	     |  +-gtags.c|
	     |           |
	     +-htag2 <---+
		+-htags.c

	Old version
	===========
	$ cd /tmp/global
	$ gtags
	Warning: './gtags' is a directory. (Ignored)
	Warning: './htags' is a directory. (Ignored)
	...
	$ global -f gtags/gtags.c
	'/tmp/work/gtags/gtags.c' is out of source tree.

	New version
	===========
	$ cd /tmp/global
	$ gtags
	$ global -f gtags/gtags.c
	usage              91 gtags/gtags.c  usage(void)
	help               98 gtags/gtags.c  help(void)
	...
	$ global -f gtags/../htags/htags.c
	mkdir              61 htags/htags.c  #define mkdir(path,mode) mkdir(path)
	link               62 htags/htags.c  #define link(one,two) (-1)
	...
	% cd gtags                                      <= get out of the source tree
	$ global -f gtags.c
	global: GTAGS not found.
	$ pwd
	/tmp/work/gtags

	Though the symbolic link to a directory might confuse users,
	it is originally as such. They should understand the characteristic.

o gtags-parser: Pick up the names of struct, union, enum and enum member
  as definitions.
o gtags.el, gtags.vim, gtags.pl: More accurate, language independent context jump.
o gtags.el: Customizable path style in the [GTAGS SELECT MODE].
  You can select one of the followings:
	root		relative from the root of the project (Default)
	relative	relative from the current directory
	absolute	absolute (=relative from the system root directory)

New options and variables:
o global: Added new --from-here option. This option is used by context jump
  facility. 
o gtags,htags,gtags-parser: Added new environment variable GTAGSFORCECPP.
  If this variable is set, each file whose suffix is 'h' is treated as
  a C++ source file.
o gtags.el: Added new variable for customizing the path style in the
  [GTAGS SELECT MODE].

Other changes:
o global.texi: Added descriptions about gtags-cscope (fake cscope).

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
o gtags.el: Changed the default path style in [GTAGS SELECT MODE] relative
  from the root of the current project. In older version, it was absolute
  by default.
o nvi-1.79-gtags.diff: Removed because nvi-1.79 is an very old package,
  and is not distributed any longer.
o gtags-parser: Removed the -d(--define) and -t(--typedef) option, because they
  have already been the default operation.

[FIXED BUGS]
o gtags: Failed to process new GCC source code.
o gtags.vim: Completion facility didn't work with the -f option of Gtags.
o htags: Self-referred links.

Version 5.6.2 - October 26 2007

[CHANGES]
* gtags-parser: In C++, ignore forward definitions of classes (e.g. "class name;")

Version 5.6.1 - August 11 2007

[CHANGES]
* gtags.conf: Added '.git/' to the DEFAULTSKIP list.

[FIXED BUGS]
* global: Global(1) with the -t option didn't print correct line number.
  Gtags.vim also didn't work correctly due to this bug. This bug was
  introduced in GLOBAL-5.4.

Version 5.6 - July 6 2007

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
* All commands: According to the GNU coding standard, the --version option
  shows always verbose message without --verbose option.

[CHANGES]
* Migrated to GNU GPLv3 and GNU LGPLv3.
* gtags-parser: Added support of assembler directive ".macro" and ".equ".

[FIXED BUGS]
* global(1): Fix memory leak.

Version 5.5 - May 5 2007

* GNU GLOBAL became a BOKINware.

* gtags-parser: Support of 'enum' (java).
* gtags.el: Changed to work without event-point function.

Version 5.4.1 - March 10 2007

[CHANGES]
* htags: Added new --item-order option.
  Specify order of items in the top page. The spec is a string
  consists of item signs in order. Each sign means as follows:
  c: caution, s: search form, m: mains, d: definition, f: files.
  The default is 'csmdf'.

[FIXED BUGS]
* htags: didn't extract some '#include' correctly.

Version 5.4 - January 29 2007

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
* Further compression of tag file (format version 5).
  Though new global can read older tag file since version-5.0, older
  global cannot read new format. It might say like follows:
	"GTAGS seems new format. Please install the latest GLOBAL."

[OTHER CHANGES]
* global: Improved performance when the -x option is not specified.
* globash.rc: Added new option -l for tag search command (x,r,s,g,P,I,f).
  This option invokes less(1) directly without tag stack.
* Verbose messages are unified.
  P option      file not found
		<n> files located
  others        object not found
		path format: <n> files located
		other format:<n> objects located

[FIXED BUGS]
* Gtags(1) and global(1) didn't work well in the system root directory('/').

Version 5.3 - November 20 2006

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
* global: Changed not to locate other symbols (-s) in GTAGSLIBPATH.
  This is the original specification of GLOBAL.
* global: Stop sorting when the -I(--idutils) option specified.
  The output of gid(idutils) is sorted by the suitable way. Though the order is
  slightly differ from global(1), it need not be sorted again.

[OTHER CHANGES]
* global:  Added new option -O(--only-other).
* htags: Added some new options and new arguments which are synonyms of config variable.
  This decreases dependence on configuration file.

  new option              | config variable
  ------------------------+-------------------------
  --disable-grep          | disable_grep
  --table-list            | table_list
  --tabs=<n>              | tabs
  --full-path             | full_path

  new argument            | config variable
  ------------------------+-------------------------
  --line-number [columns] | ncol
  --func-header [position]| definition_header
  --xhtml [version]       | xhtml_version

	(*=default)
	position: before, right, *after
	version: *1.0, 1.1

* htags: Changed to use each 'CVS/Repository' file to generate URLs if it is available.
* htags: Added '.gitignore' to the default skip file list.

* gtags.el:
  - Shorten path names in [GTAGS SELECT MODE]:
    If project directory is specified using 'gtags-visit-rootdir', gtags.el print path
    using the relative path name from the project directory, else print absolute path name.
  - Support dynamic completing-read of tag name.
    gtags-make-complete-list is deprecated. You can enjoy tag name completion without
    invoking this command.

[FIXED BUGS]
* gtags: gtags had exited when it encountered dead symbolic link.

Version 5.2 - August 8 2006

* htags: Added new options:
  - -h(--func-header) option.
  - -I(--icon) option.
  - -T(table-flist[=fields]) option.
  Suggested options:
	$ htags -vsanohIT
* htags: Changed the default color of braces from blue to red to make them stand out.
* htags: Always enable 'Grep pattern' form when the -f(--form) option specified.
  Removed config variable 'enable_grep' since it became meaningless. Instead, added
  a new variable 'disable_grep'.
* htags: Added more profitable tips in file browser.
  - File        size of bytes
  - Directory   number of files in the directory.

Version 5.1 - June 10 2006

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
* Changed the priority about the --result option to make the format
  specification easy. The --result option is given to priority more
  than the -t and -x option. (This option appeared in version 5.0.)

[OTHER CHANGES]
* Added new program 'gtags-cscope'.
  Gtags-cscope is a pseudo cscope which implements the line-oriented
  interface. You can use this command for various clients instead of
  true cscope.
* Added new format 'cscope' to the argument of --result=<format>.

Version 5.0 - April 21 2006

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
* Moved to new tag format. (GTAGS, GRTAGS, GSYMS, GPATH)
  The purpose is as follows:
  o Allows path name including blanks, at least in tag files.
    (GLOBAL still doesn't support path name which contains blanks.)
  o Decrease disk space used.
  o Make tag format simpler.
  o Realize stable performance.

  Hereafter, older tag format is not supported.
  Compact format was progressively canceled with the adoption of
  the new tag format. The -c(--compact) option of gtags(1) was removed.

  The following error messages are displayed in a wrong combination:
  - older global and new tag file
    $ global -x main
    GTAGS seems new format. Please install the latest GLOBAL.
  - new global and older tag file
    $ global -x main
    GTAGS seems older format. Please remake tag files.

  Known problem:
  - older global and new tag file
    Global(1) with the -g or -P command will always work as if invoked
    with the -o option. There is no way to avoid this problem.

New requirement:
* Added new requirement of plug-in parser
  Plug-in parser must process arguments in the order they are given
  in the command line. In each file, any order is acceptable.
  Exuberant Ctags with the -xu option meets this requirement.
  (See global.info for the detail.)

Removed options:
* gtags(1): The -c(--compact) option was removed.
  Compact format was progressively canceled with the adoption of the new
  tag format.
* gtags(1): The -o(--omit-gsyms) option was removed.
  This option was necessary in the past to use the program in a incompetent
  machine with a small hard disk. Since most recent machines has powerful
  CPU and mass hard disk. This options might already be unnecessary.
* htags(1): The --style-sheet option was removed.
  This is a really halfway option, and now nobody might need it because
  the --xhtml option became available.

[OTHER CHANGES]
New options:
* global: Added --result=<format> option. Grep format is newly supported.

  <format>: path,ctags,ctags-x,grep
        
  conventional option | newly added option
  --------------------+---------------------
  (none)              | --result=path
  -t                  | --result=ctags
  -x                  | --result=ctags-x
                      | --result=grep
        
  The -t and -x option are given to priority more than the --result
  option.

Version 4.8.7 - September 30 2005

New options:
* gtags: New --file file-list option added.
  Gtags(1) accept a file list specified by --file option.

        % find . -type f -print >/tmp/list
        % gtags --file=/tmp/list
        or
        % find . -type f -print | gtags --file=-

* gtags: New --max-args option added.

Improvement of efficiency:
* Gtags was improved of performance by changing algorithm of
  incremental updating. Along with it, the verbose message was
  greatly changed.
* Gtags was improved of performance by decreasing the frequency
  of the parser invoking.
  Under the influence of it, the verbose message is not necessarily
  real-time. If you dislike this behavior, use the --max-args
  option of gtags. You can control the frequency of the invoking
  with the option. With --max-args=1, the program does the same
  behavior as older version.
* Htags was improved of performance by decreasing the frequency
  of the parser invoking.
* Htags was improved of performance by omitting flushing temporary
  files to the disk.

Fixed bugs:
* Htags didn't treat here document of PHP source code correctly.
  (<<<WORD)
* Htags didn't treat HTML part of PHP source code correctly.

Other facilities:
* Added 'Htags Hyper-text Reference Kit'.
  The hyper-text generated by htags(1) is available from external
  programs. This kit helps you to convert the path of the source
  file into the URL in the hyper-text.

* doc/global.txi: Added the usage of Doxygen using GLOBAL.

Version 4.8.6 - May 12 2005

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
* htags: Changed the value of id attribute and name attribute of
  line number anchor from line number itself to 'L' + line number
  like this.
	<a name='100'> => <a name='L100'>
  It is because XHTML prohibit the id attribute which starts
  with a digit. If you refer these anchors from outer system,
  please rewrite it.

[OTHER CHANGES]
* htags: New option --insert-header and --insert-footer added.

Version 4.8.5 - April 19 2005

* htags: XHTML support(--xhtml) added.
  If the --frame option is specified then generate XHTML-1.0 Frameset,
  else if config variable 'xhtml_version' is set to 1.1 then generate
  XHTML-1.1 else XHTML 1.0 Transitional.
  You can customize the appearance using style sheet file 'style.css'.
* htags: Added config variable 'xhtml_version'.
* htags: Added 'html/' to the fault skip list of htags(1).
  It is the output directory of doxygen document.
* gtags-parser: Added yacc directives introduced in bison-2.0.
  %default-prec(%default_prec)
  %expect-rr(%expect_rr)
  %initial-action
  %no-default-prec(%no_default_prec,%no_default-prec,%no-default_prec)
  %nondeterministic-parser

Version 4.8.4 - March 4 2005

Fixed bugs:
* gtags-parser: C and C++ parser was broken.
* gnusort: Compile error in Solaris environment.

Version 4.8.3 - February 26 2005

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
* DOS and Windows 32 support ended.
  But it doesn't mean the deletion of the code for DOS and Windows 32.
  We leave the support to outside projects and accept the code
  from them as is. Therefore, anything has not changed substantially
  up to now.
* Command gctags(1) was renamed to gtags-parser(1) because some systems
  have another 'gctags' which is not GLOBAL's.
* About gtags-parser(1), language type of source file is decided
  only by the suffix. In older version, *.h file was considered
  to be C++ source file if it includes token 'class'. But the new version
  considers it always C source file. If you want to consider it C++
  then you must redefine new config variable 'langmap'.
  
[OTHER CHANGES]
Fixed bugs:
* htags: The --gtagsconf and --gtagslabel option didn't work correctly.
* htags: Buffer overflow occurred in dupindex.c:makedupindex().
* htags: Could not ignore path name which includes blank correctly.
New features:
* gtags,htags: New config variable 'langmap' added.
  This variable is used for customizing the mapping of languages and the
  parsers, and it includes the function of obsoleted 'suffixes' variable.
  If you use 'suffixes' then it is effective else GLOBAL internally
  generates the value of 'suffixes' from the 'langmap'.
  The reason to continue 'suffixes' is that it is needed for plug-in parser.
  If you don't use plug-in parser then you should use 'langmap' instead.
* htags: New config variable 'copy_files' added.
  If the -f option is used then htags makes links of tag files in 'cgi-bin'
  directory by default. With this variable, htags copy tag files instead of
  linking.

Version 4.8.2 - November 11 2004

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
* Postgres support ended.
* Htags.pl (perl version of htags) was removed completely.
* Config variable sed_command and sort_command were removed.
  The sed(1) and sort(1) are not necessary any longer.

[OTHER CHANGES]
Fixed bugs:
* Wrong output of 'global -Po' was fixed.

New features:
* gctags(assembly language):
  - In addition to `call', `jsr' is recognized as call instruction.
    Although various call instructions exist like `bl' or `calls',
    only `call' and `jsr' are used widely.
  - Macros like ENTRY or EXT are taken up as reference,
    when definitions exist in somewhere else.
  - Warning is displayed when a comment is not closed.
  - C_SYMBOL_NAME and C_ENTRY are recognized as a macro
    which shows the start of a function.
  - The string which is not closed finishes at the end of line.
    This behavior is the same as GNU C pre-processor.
  - The check of correspondence of "#if" and "#endif" was deleted.
    This did not exist in version 4.8.
* New directory '.snprj/' was added to the DEFAULTSKIP list.
  This is the tag directory of Source-Navigator.

Version 4.8.1 - October 6 2004

Fixed bugs:
* htags: The -d option of htags didn't work.
* htags: didn't recognize continued line and null directive(#).

New features:
* htags: make suffix list of include file configurable.
  (See man htags(1). config variables: include_file_suffixes)
* htags: try TMP if TMPDIR doesn't exist.(only DJGPP)
* htags: Warn about unknown pre-processing directive. As the exception,
  when unknown preprocessing directive appeared in assembly source,
  it will be recognized as the start of a shell comment.  
* htags: Add all yacc directives understood by bison-1.875.

Version 4.8 - August 26 2004

* The htags(1) was rewritten in C language completely. It is compatible
  with the perl version and the performance has improved greatly.
  The perl version is left in the package for the time being as
  '/usr/local/bin/htags.pl' by default.
* htags: In PHP language, pickup variables in strings. ("${aaa}")
* gctags: Reserved word __thread added in C and C++.

Version 4.7.2 - June 7 2004

Fixed bugs:
* Obsolete style of sort(1) still remained.

Version 4.7.1 - June 1 2004

New features:
* Support home_etc(3) facility on PLD Linux/GNU.
* gctags: Pick up external defined functions as symbols.

Fixed bugs:
* GLOBAL doesn't work with the GNU sort(1) based on POSIX 1003.1-2001.
  The GNU sort(1) with the latest glibc doesn't accept obsolete
  +POS1[-POS2] style option.
* GLOBAL-4.3 and the later couldn't treat shadow tree.

Version 4.7 - Feb 1 2004

* gtags.vim: Plug-in script integrates GLOBAL with vim editor.
* global.txi: The usage of gtags.vim script added.
* global: The -o option becomes available with -P command.
* gctags: [bug fixed] Gctags couldn't recognize definitions in namespace block.
* Install gtags.conf and other files to $datadir/gtags.
* Borland C++ compiler support in Windows32 was finished because
  - Now, Cygwin environment is widely used.
  - Borland C++ compiler is not free software.

  The w32/ directory is leaved in this release but will be removed in the
  future release.

Version 4.6.1 - Oct 3 2003

* gtags, htags, gctags: Added '.hpp' to the suffix list of C++ source file.

Version 4.6 - July 2 2003

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
* The default value of the config variable 'definition_header' was changed
  to 'no', because the definition header is unsightly according to the place,
  especially in class definition.

[OTHER CHANGES]
* Added support for PHP language.
  (Known problems in htags)
  - The variable in string cannot be recognized.(global can recognize that.)
  - In HTML, the character string of the same spelling as the reserved
    word of PHP is recognized as a reserved word of PHP.
  I will rewrite htags in C language in the future to solve above problems.
* Added support for SCM_DEFINE macro which is part of guile-snarf.
* Added 'right' as a value of config variable 'definition_header'.
* Added some tool tips.
  - Alphabet in alphabetical index shows the count of definitions.
  - File name in file index show the full path name.
  - Anchor to duplicate index show the number of duplicated objects.
* Added .cvsrc,.cvsignore,.cvspass,.cvswrappers,autom4te.cache/
  to the default skip list.

Always thanks to Hideki Iwamoto san for his contribution.

Version 4.5.3 - June 5 2003

[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

* htags: Htags does not generate the code of javascript at all.
  In the former version, we used javascript to display information about
  links. But a browser these days had come to support the tool tip using
  'title' attribute. So, we replaced the function using tool tip instead
  of javascript facility.
* The --no-javascript option was removed because it was already unnecessary.
* global: The pattern of the argument came always to be interpreted
  as a extended regular expression. In the former version, there was both
  the case for the pattern to be interpreted as a basic regular expression
  and the interpretation as the extended regular expression. This depended
  on the environment of the build. (If you have grep(1) and xargs(1),

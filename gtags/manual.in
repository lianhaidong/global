@NAME	gtags - create tag files for global.
@SYNOPSIS
	@name{gtags} [-c][-i][-I][-o][-P][-q][-v][-w][@arg{dbpath}]
@DESCRIPTION
	@name{Gtags} recursively collect the source files under
	the current directory,
	pickup symbols and write the cross-reference data into tag files
	(@file{GTAGS}, @file{GRTAGS}, @file{GSYMS} and @file{GPATH}).
	You should execute this command at the root of the source tree.

	C, C++, yacc, java, PHP and Assembly source files are supported.
	Files whose names end in @file{.c} or @file{.h} are assumed to be
	C source files and are searched for C style routine and macro
	definitions.
	Files whose names end in @file{.c++} @file{.cc} @file{.cpp} @file{.cxx}
	@file{.hxx} @file{.hpp} @file{.C} @file{.H} are assumed to be C++ source files.
	Files whose names end in @file{.y} are assumed to be YACC source files.
	Files whose names end in @file{.java} are assumed to be Java source files.
	Files whose names end in @file{.php} @file{.php3} @file{.phtml} are
	assumed to be PHP source files.
	Files whose names end in @file{.s} or @file{.S}
	are assumed to be Assembler source files.
	Other files are searched for C style definitions.
@OPTIONS
	The following options are available:
	@begin_itemize
	@item{@option{-c}, @option{--compact}}
		Make tag files with compact format.
	@item{@option{--config} @arg{name}}
		Show the value of config variable @arg{name}.
		If @arg{name} is not specified then show whole of config entry.
	@item{@option{--gtagsconf} @arg{file}}
		Load user's configuration from @arg{file}.
	@item{@option{--gtagslabel} @arg{label}}
		@arg{label} is used as the label of configuration file.
		The default is @code{default}.
	@item{@option{-i}, @option{--incremental}}
		Update tag files incrementally. You had better use
		@xref{global,1} with the -u option.
	@item{@option{-I}, @option{--idutils}}
		Make index files for @xref{id-utils,1}.
	@item{@option{--info} @arg{info}}
		Pass info string to external system.
		Currently you can use it with -P option.
	@item{@option{-o}, @option{--omit-gsyms}}
		Suppress making @file{GSYMS} file.
		Use this option if you don't use -s option of @xref{global,1}.
	@item{@option{-q}, @option{--quiet}}
		Quiet mode.
	@item{@option{-v}, @option{--verbose}}
		Verbose mode.
	@item{@option{-w}, @option{--warning}}
		Print warning messages.
	@item{@arg{dbpath}, @option{--warning}}
		The directory in which tag files are generated.
		The default is the current directory.
		It is useful when your source directory is on a read only
		device like CDROM.
	@end_itemize
@EXAMPLES
	$ ls -F
	Makefile      src/    lib/
	$ gtags -v
	$ global -x main
	main              10 src/main.c  main (argc, argv) {
@FILES
	@begin_itemize
	@item{@file{GTAGS}}
		Tag file for function definitions.
	@item{@file{GRTAGS}}
		Tag file for function references.
	@item{@file{GSYMS}}
		Tag file for other symbols.
	@item{@file{GPATH}}
		Tag file for path of source files.
	@item{@file{/etc/gtags.conf}, @file{$HOME/.globalrc}}
		Configuration file.
	@end_itemize
@ENVIRONMENT
	The following environment variables affect the execution of @name{gtags}:
	@begin_itemize
	@item{@var{GTAGSCONF}}
		If this variable is set, its value is used as the
		configuration file. The default is @file{$HOME/.globalrc}.
	@item{@var{GTAGSLABEL}}
		If this variable is set, its value is used as the label
		of configuration file. The default is @code{default}.
	@item{@var{GTAGSCACHE}}
		If this variable is set, its value is used as the size of
		btree cache. The default is 500000 (bytes).
	@end_itemize
@CONFIGURATION
	The following configuration variables affect the execution of @name{gtags}.
	You can see the default value for each variable with the @option{--config} option.
	@begin_itemize
	@item{@code{GTAGS}(string)}
		If this variable is set, its value is used as the
		command line of parser for GTAGS. The default is @file{gtags-parser -dt %s}.
	@item{@code{GRTAGS}(string)}
		If this variable is set, its value is used as the
		command line of parser for GRTAGS. The default is @file{gtags-parser -dtr %s}.
	@item{@code{GSYMS}(string)}
		If this variable is set, its value is used as the
		command line of parser for GSYMS. The default is @file{gtags-parser -dts %s}.
	@item{@code{skip}(comma separated list)}
		@name{Gtags} skips files which listed in this list.
		As a special exception, @name{gtags} collect values from multiple @code{skip} variables.
		If the value ends with '/', it assumed as a directory and @name{gtags} skips all files under it.
		If the value start with '/', it assumed relative path from the root of source directory.
	@item{@code{suffixes}(comma separated list)}
		Suffixes of target source file.
		As a special exception, @name{gtags} collect values from multiple @code{suffixes} variables.
		This variable is obsoleted. If the langmap variable is defined
		@name{gtags} no longer refers this.
	@item{@code{format}(standard|compact)}
		Format of tag files. The default is @code{standard}.
		Compact format is same to @option{-c}(@option{--compact}).
	@item{@code{icase_path}(boolean)}
		Ignore case distinctions in the path.
		Suffixes check are affected by this capability.
	@item{@code{langmap}(comma separated list)}
		Language mapping. Each comma-separated map consists of
		the language name, a colon, and a list of file extensions.
		Default mapping is 'c:.c.h,yacc:.y,asm:.s.S,java:.java,cpp:.c++.cc.cpp.cxx.hxx.hpp.C.H,php:.php.php3.phtml'.
	@end_itemize
@DIAGNOSTICS
	@name{Gtags} exits with a non 0 value if an error occurred, 0 otherwise.
@MESSAGE FORMAT
	Verbose message has important level. The most important level is 0,
	the second is 1 and so on. All the message has level numbers leading
	blanks.

@BUG
	@file{GTAGS}, @file{GRTAGS} and @file{GSYMS} are very large.
	In advance of using this command, check the space of your disk.

	Assembler support is far from complete.
	It extracts only ENTRY() and ALTENTRY() from source file.
	Probably valid only for FreeBSD and Linux kernel source.

	There is no concurrency control about tag files.

	Symbols in Assembly source files are not extracted for @file{GSYMS}.

@HISTORY

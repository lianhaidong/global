~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation of GNU GLOBAL under UNIX.

1. Preparation.

o PERL version 4 or later is needed for htags.

   If you don't have it, you can fetch it from this site.

	http://www.perl.com/CPAN/


o Groff is needed for formatting online manuals.

   Online manuals in GLOBAL are written with 'mandoc' macro which is a part
   of GNU groff package. See following site:

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/groff/

   You can format these manuals by following command line manually.

	% groff -Wall -Tascii -mandoc global.1

   If you replace your system's nroff(1) with GNU's one(nroff.sh) then
   you can use man(1) to see GLOBAL's online manuals.

o If you want to use the -I option of global(1) then id-utils(1) is needed.

   You can get id-utils at:

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/id-utils/
  

2. How to install.

   You need GNU make. It may be named 'gmake' on your system.

	% ./configure
	% make				<- GNU make
	# make install


3. Using GLOBAL with editors.

o Nvi

   Please get nvi-1.79 at:

	   http://www.bostic.com/vi/

   and do the followings.

	% tar xzvf nvi-1.79.tar.gz
	% cd nvi-1.79
	% patch -p < ../nvi/nvi-1.79-gtags.diff
	% cd build
	% ./configure
	% make
	# make install

o Emacs

   Global supports GNU Emacs and XEmacs. If you meet some troubles,
   please let me know.

   You can get them at:

	GNU emacs:
		ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/
	XEmacs:
		http://www.xemacs.org

   If you have installed it then copy gtags.el in this package to the emacs
   lisp library directory or place the file in a directory
   (for example "~/lisp") and write $HOME/.emacs like this.

	+-----------------------------------------------
	|(setq load-path (cons "~/lisp" load-path))

o Elvis

   You need Elvis 2.1 or later. You can get it at:

	http://www.fh-wedel.de/elvis/

   You need not any patch for it.

Good luck!
